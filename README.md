# Project Title:
# A simple Weather Forecast application as Volvo Company Technical Assessment

# Project Description:
# This project is an assignment as a part of Volvo Company technical assessment process. What the app
does is to first fetch 6 locations including Gothenburg, Stockholm, Mountain View, London,
New York and Berlin from the MetaWeather REST API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/) and then show
 the tomorrow's weather forecast by clicking on each item. In the second page there are some weather-
 information for the selected city including temperature, weather state with appropriate image,
 wind speed, humidity  etc. Because of the given time and implementation boundaries, UI is kept
 very simple and is implemented using Single Activity and Fragment Based design.
Project is implemented by Android Kotlin using MVVM and Clean Code architecture and by using
following key libraries and tools:

- Kotlin: as the development language

- Koin: as the Dependency Injection library

- Coroutines: as the Reactive Programming and async call management library

- Retrofit: as the Restful API management library

- Navigation Component: as the navigation management library

- MockWebServer: as the Mocking web server for Testing

- Junit: as the Unit Testing library
